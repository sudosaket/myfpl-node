# Custom FPL

Once there were a group of friends who loved to play the Fantasy Premier League.  So they made Excel sheets and tables each week with the new data and they discussed the transfers to be made via chat groups.

But they were developers. They were engineers. They were lazy. There had to be better way, surely!

And so, this is an attempt to take those painstakingly boring tasks (which were so unfun they defeated the purpose of the game) out of the game.

This is an attempt to truly make it a game.
