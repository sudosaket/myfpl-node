# Custom FPL

Once there were a group of friends who loved to play the Fantasy Premier League.  So they made Excel sheets and tables each week with the new data and they discussed the transfers to be made via chat groups.

But they were developers. They were engineers. They were lazy. There had to be better way, surely!

And so, this is an attempt to take those painstakingly boring tasks (which were so unfun they defeated the purpose of the game) out of the game.

This is an attempt to truly make it a game.

# Things to do

* Add upcoming fixtures to home if not logged in
* Add indexes for selected team, past teams
* Add transfer history database
* Add current selected team and points to home if logged in
* Add things to settings view
* Add table to standings view with latest gw and total points
